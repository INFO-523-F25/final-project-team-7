# Source Code (`src/`)

This folder contains all **preprocessing** and **utility** scripts used in the project  
**“Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic Using the NSL-KDD Dataset.”**

These scripts prepare raw network connection records for analysis,  
handle feature transformation, and provide helper functions to support  
data exploration and modeling.
