You can use the display style with double dollar signs:\n\n```         \n$$\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$\n```\n\n$$\n\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\n$$\n\nLimitations:\n\n1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;\n\n2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Feeling adventurous?\n\n-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.\n\n-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.\n\n",
