Or more specifically, which unsupervised techniques — such as Z-Score, Elliptic Envelope, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and DBSCAN — perform best in distinguishing normal traffic from various attack families (DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R)? \nHow does the performance of machine learning–based intrusion detection models compare to traditional statistical anomaly detectors? Or more specifically, which algorithms — including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, and Deep Autoencoders — achieve higher accuracy, precision, and recall when detecting network intrusions, and what trade-offs exist in terms of interpretability and computational cost?"

    "text": "Analysis plan\nWeek 1 – Problem Definition & Data Preparation The first week focuses on defining the objectives of anomaly detection within the NSL-KDD dataset. The dataset will be loaded, inspected, and preprocessed to ensure analytical readiness. Tasks include handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical variables. Deliverables: Data preparation notebook and summary report.\nWeek 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) This phase aims to understand data distributions, feature correlations, and patterns of normal versus attack traffic. Visualization techniques will be applied to highlight key discriminative features and potential sources of anomaly. Deliverables: EDA notebook with visual insights and descriptive summaries.\nWeek 3 – Statistical Anomaly Detection Methods In this stage, classical statistical methods for anomaly detection will be implemented, including Z-Score, Elliptical Envelope, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and DBSCAN. Their performance in identifying abnormal network behaviors will be analyzed and compared. Deliverables: Statistical anomaly detection notebook and comparative summary.\nWeek 4 – Machine Learning–Based Methods Modern learning-based detectors will be explored using Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Deep Autoencoders. Models will be tuned for optimal performance, and detection boundaries will be visualized to interpret decision behavior. Deliverables: ML anomaly detection notebook and evaluation metrics.\nWeek 5 – Model Evaluation and Comparison All implemented methods will be assessed using standard performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and Detection Rate. Comparative analyses and ablation studies will be performed to evaluate robustness and generalization. Deliverables: Evaluation notebook and performance report.\nWeek 6 – Final Analysis & Reporting The final week synthesizes results into a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of different anomaly detection techniques. The findings will discuss practical implications, advantages, and limitations of each approach in real-world intrusion detection scenarios. Deliverables: Final project report and presentation slides."
