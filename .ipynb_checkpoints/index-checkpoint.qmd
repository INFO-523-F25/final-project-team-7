## Abstract

The objective of this project is to develop an anomaly detection framework for identifying malicious network activities using the NSL-KDD dataset, a benchmark for evaluating intrusion detection systems (IDS). Anomalies, or data points that diverge from normal network behavior, often signify potential security threats such as intrusions or fraudulent activities. <br>
The project integrates both statistical and machine learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Statistical methods—including z-score analysis, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and density-based clustering—will be applied to uncover unusual traffic patterns.<br>
In parallel, machine learning models such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders will be trained to detect complex, non-linear anomalies. Through systematic exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, the study aims to compare and assess the effectiveness of these techniques in accurately identifying abnormal network behavior.<br>
The outcome will contribute to improving automated intrusion detection systems and strengthening cybersecurity defenses against evolving network threats.
