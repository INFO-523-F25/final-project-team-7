description: "Develop and compare supervised and unsupervised approaches for detecting anomalous network behavior in an enterprise-style intrusion detection system (IDS) using the **NSL-KDD dataset**. <br> 
The NSL-KDD dataset is an enhanced and cleaned version of the original **KDD Cup 1999** dataset, designed to remove redundant records and mitigate class imbalance issues. 
  It contains **41 network connection features** representing protocol type, service, flag indicators, and traffic statistics, along with a target label identifying normal or one of four major attack families: 
  **Denial of Service (DoS)**, **Probe**, **Remote to Local (R2L)**, and **User to Root (U2R)**. <br>
  The full dataset includes nearly **4 million network connection records**, from which this project uses a **randomly selected 10% subset** to ensure computational feasibility while maintaining representative class proportions. <br>

The analysis pipeline includes robust preprocessing — categorical feature encoding (One-Hot Encoding), numeric feature scaling (StandardScaler), and dimensionality reduction (PCA) — followed by both **unsupervised statistical methods** (Z-Score, Elliptic Envelope, LOF, DBSCAN) and **supervised learning models** (Random Forest, SVM, Isolation Forest, Deep Autoencoder).

## Abstract

This project designs a reproducible intrusion-detection framework that evaluates both unsupervised and supervised learning on the NSL-KDD dataset. 
Because the full corpus contains nearly four million connections, we employ a randomly sampled 10% subset to maintain representative class proportions while enabling efficient experimentation. Unsupervised detectors (Z-Score, Elliptic Envelope, Local Outlier Factor, DBSCAN) are trained using only normal traffic and converted to decisions via percentile-based thresholds (e.g., 95th percentile). Supervised and semi-supervised models (Random Forest, SVM, Isolation Forest, Deep Autoencoder) are trained on labeled traffic.<br>

Preprocessing includes one-hot encoding for categorical features (protocol_type, service, flag), standardization of numeric variables, and PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization. Severe class imbalance—especially in R2L and U2R—is addressed with SMOTE oversampling and class-weight adjustments. Evaluation follows a stratified 80/20 train–test split with 5-fold cross-validation, reporting Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Detection Rate, and family-wise performance to expose sensitivity across attack categories. 
Model interpretability leverages feature importance (tree-based models), SHAP explanations (SVM/autoencoders), PCA decision views, and reconstruction-error analyses.<br>

All experiments use fixed random seeds, versioned notebooks, and dependency pinning for full reproducibility. 
While NSL-KDD is dated relative to modern encrypted, high-throughput networks, its labeled structure remains valuable for controlled benchmarking. 
Outcomes include a comparative assessment of accuracy, efficiency, and explainability, along with practical guidance for deploying anomaly-detection components in enterprise and IoT contexts.
